	abstract = {Semantic analysis is becoming increasingly important not only in computing but also in the business world. The purpose of the current study is to apply semantic network analysis to the service industry, one of the economic sectors. To learn more about the crowded environment in the service sector, the study interviewed customers and employees by using dyad approach in the service sector. The data collected was analyzed using a text mining approach in Python library and Ucinet software. The text data collected through interviews was analyzed using multiple techniques like sentiment analysis, centrality analysis, and {CONCOR} analysis. The results from the two data sets of interviews with employees and consumers revealed certain effects and behavior that they exhibit in a crowded environment. When providing services to consumers in a crowded environment, employees experience a variety of behavioral changes, whether due to physical, psychological, emotional, habitual, or work-related factors. Additionally, findings show that crowding has an emotional and psychological impact on customers’ behavioral responses. The study offers important implications of text analysis for business intelligence.},

	abstract = {The modern labor market demands that educational institutions prepare specialists capable of effectively responding to rapidly changing professional standards and technologies. In this regard, the use of innovative approaches to adapt educational programs has become a key factor. This study is dedicated to developing a methodology for using heterogeneous knowledge graphs to create a recommendation system aimed at bridging the gap between existing educational courses and the dynamically changing requirements of the labor market. The central element of the study is the use of knowledge graphs to aggregate and analyze diverse data on skills, job vacancies, and educational courses. Knowledge graphs not only structure large volumes of information but also visualize complex connections between various educational modules and professional requirements. This approach fosters a deeper understanding of how educational programs can be adjusted to match the market specifics. An important aspect of the study is the application of multilingual semantic similarity algorithms to analyze and match skills. These algorithms play a key role in determining the degree of correspondence between the skills listed in educational programs and courses, and those required for specific job vacancies. The use of natural language processing techniques allows not only capturing explicit keyword matches, but also recognizing deep semantic connections, which is an integral part of accurate matching in educational and professional domains. The results of the study demonstrate that the proposed methodology can effectively analyze the multilingual relationships between educational and professional skills, which improves personalized courses and job recommendations. Our study contributes to the literature by proposing a new methodology for building recommendations that improves the accuracy of personalized educational and career recommendations, and facilitates the adaptation of educational programs to dynamic changes in the labor market.},

	abstract = {Citation recommendations hold substantial academic importance in the era of big scholarly data. The tasks not only depend on the semantic expression of publications, but also are associated with structural information. Recently, many recommendation tasks have been modeled using network-based representations, where nodes signify entities and edges indicate their interactions. Creating node representations with fusing both semantic and structural information in network and considering citation recommendation as publication node similarity searching task is an effective solution. In order to achieve this goal, existing works consistently interact two publications. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing semantic links within a bibliographic network for citation recommendations. The basic motivation is to construct semantic links on network instead of the role of keywords. The semantic links denote two publications sharing similar semantic meanings and provide valuable supervision to learn publication representations. To obtain high-quality semantic links, we create them on network with high-similarity other publications' text representations captured from the two-level hierarchical and transparent information (word-sentence-document). This word-sentence-document information reflects the hierarchical structure of publication texts, accurately capturing their semantics. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of semantic link in bibliographic network-based citation recommendation using two real-world datasets.},

	abstract = {In recent years, online education has developed rapidly, providing a vast array of educational resources. Course recommendation algorithms are crucial for {MOOC} platforms, as they can alleviate the issue of information overload to a certain extent. Due to the cold start problem in recommendation algorithms, researchers have introduced Knowledge Graphs ({KG}) to address this issue. However, many course recommendation algorithms based on Knowledge Graphs overlook the learning intentions of students when selecting courses, which leads to a decrease in recommendation accuracy. Additionally, the introduction of information such as Knowledge Graphs can bring noise, reducing the performance of the recommendation system. In response to these challenges, We proposes a course recommendation algorithm called Knowledge Graph Intent Network and Multi-graph Contrastive Learning ({KGIMCL}).This paper delves into the modeling of the interaction intentions between students and courses based on the Knowledge Graph Intent Network, employing attention mechanism strategies to more effectively measure the importance of different relationships within the Knowledge Graph. Furthermore, this paper introduces a novel multi-graph contrastive learning approach. Specifically, it contrasts the course embeddings generated by the Knowledge Graph Intent Network with those generated by the course semantic relationship graph. This contrastive learning strategy enhances the model's performance by reducing the noise introduced by additional knowledge information while incorporating more knowledge into the recommendation system. This paper provides a perspective for {MOOC} platforms when developing algorithms, considering the learning intentions of students when selecting courses, and reducing the noise that additional information such as Knowledge Graphs might cause in the recommendation system through contrastive learning. The effectiveness of this model is validated on a public {MOOC} dataset.},

	abstract = {Knowledge Representation ({KR}) is an emerging field of research in {AI} and Data Mining. Knowledge represented in an effective way guarantees a good retrieval. In this regard, a number of effective approaches have been proposed in the literature and Semantic Networks ({SN}) are one of them. In {SN} knowledge is represented in the form of directed graph, where concepts and relationships are appeared at vertices and edges respectively. ‘is a’ is one of the most frequently used relationship in {SN}. ‘is a’ expresses the exact relationship between any pair of objects. But there exists a huge amount of knowledge that cannot be represented by just ‘is a’, like the knowledge where approximations are involved. To overcome this issue, fuzzy semantic networks ({FSN}) are proposed in this chapter. In {FSN} ‘is a’ is replaced by a fuzzy membership function ‘µ’ having value between [0,1]. So the relationship between a pair of concepts can be expressed as a certain degree of membership. This chapter focuses on applications of {FSN} and its significance over the traditional {SN}.},

Ontologies provide a structured framework for organizing knowledge within a domain, facilitating more precise and efficient recommendation strategies. We employ a hybrid recommendation approach that combines collaborative filtering with content-based filtering methodologies. Collaborative filtering analyzes user actions and preferences to identify similar users and suggest items they have shown interest in. In contrast, content-based filtering focuses on the attributes and features of products to recommend items that align with the user’s preferences. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our ontology-based recommendation system, we conducted experiments using real- world e- commerce data. The results indicate that our system outperforms traditional recommendation techniques in terms of accuracy and user satisfaction.},

Despite advancements in natural languages processing tools, statistical linguistics models, graph theory and visualization, there is no framework that combines these piece-wise tools under one roof. We designed and constructed a Semantic Network Analysis Pipeline ({SNAP}) that is available as an open-source web-service that implements work-ﬂow needed by a data scientist to explore historical semantic concepts in a text corpus. We deﬁne a graph theoretic notion of a semantic concept as a ﬂow of closely related tokens through the corpus of text. The modular work-ﬂow pipeline processes text using natural language processing tools, statistical content narrowing, creates semantic networks from lexical token chaining, performs social network analysis of token networks and creates a 3D visualization of the semantic concept ﬂows through corpus for interactive concept exploration. Finally, we illustrate the framework’s utility to extract the information from a text corpus of Herman Melville’s novel Moby Dick, the transcript of the 2015–2016 United States (U.S.) Senate Hearings on Environment and Public Works, and the Australian Broadcast Corporation’s short news articles on rural and science topics.},

	abstract = {Most current recommendation models based on knowledge graphs use graph attention mechanisms to perform semantic aggregation of nodes and their neighbors, but this approach can lead to the loss of consistency information among neighboring nodes. Moreover, many recommendation models incorporate contrastive learning to suppress noise in knowledge graphs, often neglecting to enhance model robustness through parameter updates. Therefore, we proposed a recommendation model called {FITAALIGN} that integrates knowledge graphs with semantic alignment. Firstly, it is argued that the embedded representation of a node aggregated with its neighboring nodes in the knowledge graphs should possess similar semantic representations, which is achieved through similarity calculations to ensure embedded similarity of node representations. Secondly, conditional alignment is used to overcome the loss of node consistency information caused by encoding user-item graphs, thereby obtaining high-quality node semantic representations. Finally, to mitigate the impact of noise interference in the knowledge graphs, adversarial noise is firstly introduced into the model's network parameters, followed by adversarial training to strengthen the robustness of the model. Experiment results on two public datasets validate that our model outperforms some advanced methods. Respectively, on the Recall@20, there was an average increase of 54.99\% and 14.57\%; on the {NDCG}@20, the increases were 60.22\% and 23.76\%; and on the {HR}@20, the increases were 42.94\% and 10.70\%.},

The algorithm in use involves the design of elaborate ontologies for each product, including a wide variety of attributes, relationships, and semantic representations. Such ontologies are then processed, with the application of semantic learning techniques to gain an all-rounded understanding of products and user preference. It uses semantic similarity measures between the user profile ontology and ontologies of relevant products for highly matched product retrieval concerning both the explicit and inferred preferences of the user. The most important novelty of {SOBPRA} is its deep semantic processing capability, which enables the system to detect complex relationships and preferences beyond superficial data. This algorithm continuously learns from user interactions, improving ontologies to better provide more accurate recommendations by ranking organic product first.

In the singular, bibliography is presented as one of the disciplines whose principal area of study is recorded knowledge. The term bibliographies in plural denotes the use of the bibliographic method for the development of information products through standards and norms that allow control, exchange and access to knowledge. Bibliographic databases and indexing and abstracting (A\&I) services are sophisticated information products through the use of information technologies, the web, cataloguing programs or systems, and machine-readable formats, such as the {MARC} format, which accelerates access and exchange of information between national agencies, libraries, research institutes and information users in real time and remotely. Bibliography as a discipline still requires theoretical-epistemological studies that can position it as one of the disciplines of recorded information, addressing articulation between theory and practice, the object of study, and the epistemological matrix. Although these theoretical approaches are not frequent - since bibliography tends to be seen only as a practice, an instrument or a method - comprehensive approaches that show bibliography in the context of information technology and science disciplines are even less frequent.},

However, often the most important expectation for {RSs} used in commercial applications is to improve the business performance of the organization. For this reason, alongside the growth of e-business, we have witnessed growing interest in value-aware {RSs} that, unlike traditional {RSs}, are designed to optimize the economic value of recommendations by considering the objectives of multiple stakeholders. In this paper, we provide a systematic literature review, following the {PRISMA} guidelines, specialized in value-aware {RSs}. We explore key commercial applications, main algorithms, value categories typically optimized, and the most commonly used datasets. Furthermore, we note limitations of the state-of-the-art approaches and identify future research directions.},

	abstract = {Tremendous academic information causes serious information overload problems while supporting scientific research. Scientific paper and citation recommendation systems have been developed to relieve this problem and work as a filter to furnish only relevant papers to researchers. Although previous studies have made comparative progress, this problem is still challenging because current paper recommendation systems rely on heterogeneous and multi-sourced features, thereby requiring a unified learning representation to cover different types and modalities of information. Additionally, the implicit influence of scholars’ previous preferences of writing and citing on his/her new manuscript has not been well considered in the previous studies. Facing the issue from these two aspects, in this paper, a heterogeneous knowledge embedding-based attentive {RNN} model is proposed to recommend scientific paper citations. First, the preparation of features consists of two parts: (1) building a unified learning representation of structural entities and relations for recommending paper citations; and (2) defining and constructing a bibliographic network comprising five types of entities and five relations. The bibliographic network enables learning a unified representation so that all graphical entities and relations can be vectorized using {TransD}. To establish textual representations, the {PV}-{DM} model is utilized to generate numeric features for the title of each paper. Second, by combining structural and textual representations focusing on the “author-text query” scenario, an attentive bidirectional {RNN} is constructed to recommend paper and citation based on an user’s identity with a length-limited inquiry to capture the scholars’ previous writing and citing preferences, thereby reducing recommendation error. Through the {DBLP} dataset, our experiment results show the feasibility and effectiveness of our method, both in terms of the number as well as the quality of the first few recommended items. In specific, compared with existing models, our model has improved {MRR} and {NDCG} by approximately 4.8\% and 2.4\%, respectively.},

	abstract = {The growing popularity of digital libraries as a medium for communicating scientific discoveries has made a large variety of research articles easily accessible. However, this constitutes a putative issue of information overloading with recommendation engines providing a compelling solution to the problem. Scientific Recommender Systems alleviate this problem by suggesting potential papers of interest to a user. For any researcher seeking developments in their field, it is important that the recommended papers are of high quality, recent and related to the field of interest, which has been largely overlooked in prior approaches. This study thus proposes a graph-based hybrid recommendation technique, {SPACE}-R, that amalgamates quality, semantic similarity and community structure of nodes in a citation network. The creation of a popularity network, a derivative of a citation network, in combination with a two-stage candidate selection process involving community detection and neighbourhood network identification, contributes to an improvement in the accuracy and scalability of the proposed model. The incorporation of semantic similarity achieves the necessary diversity in recommendations. Experimental evaluations on four large datasets against five baselines reveal that {SPACE}-R achieves an improvement of up to 45.53\%, 56.76\%, 49.39\%, 46.84\% and 78.18\% in recall, precision, {MRR}, {mAP}, and response time, respectively.},

This review has been conducted to identify the contextual information and methods used for making recommendations in digital libraries as well as the way researchers understood and used relevant contextual information from the years 2001 to 2013 based on the Kitchenham systematic review methodology. The results indicated that contextual information incorporated into recommendations can be categorised into three contexts, namely users’ context, document’s context, and environment context. In addition, the classical approaches such as collaborative filtering were employed more than the other approaches. Researchers have understood and exploited relevant contextual information through four ways, including citation of past studies, citation of past definitions, self-definitions, and field-query researches; however, citation of the past studies has been the most popular method. This review highlights the need for more investigations on the concept of context from user viewpoint in scholarly domains. It also discusses the way a context-aware recommender system can be effectively designed and implemented in digital libraries.

As a result, we developed an educational collaborative filtering recommender agent, with an integrated learning style finder. The agent produces two types of recommendations: suggestions and shortcuts for learning materials and learning tools, helping the learner to better navigate through educational resources. Shortcuts are created taking into account only the user’s profile, while suggestions are created using the choices made by the learners with similar learning styles. The learning style finder assigns to each user a profile model, taking into account an index of learning styles, as well as patterns discovered in the virtual behavior of the user.

	abstract = {Researchers typically need to filter several academic papers to find those relevant to their research. This filtering is cumbersome and time-consuming because the number of published academic papers is growing exponentially. Some researchers have focused on developing better recommender systems for academic papers by using citation analysis and content analysis. Most traditional content analysis is implemented using a keyword matching process, and thus it cannot consider the semantic contexts of items. Further, citation analysis-based techniques rely on the number of links directly citing or being cited in a single-level network. Consequently, it may be difficult to recommend the appropriate papers when the paper of interest does not have enough citation information. To address these problems, we propose a recommendation system for academic papers that combines citation analysis and network analysis. The proposed method is based on multilevel citation networks that compare all the indirectly linked papers to the paper of interest to inspect the structural and semantic relationships among them. Thus, the proposed method tends to recommend informative and useful papers related to both the research topic and the academic theory. The comparison results based on real data showed that the proposed method outperformed the Google Scholar and {SCOPUS} algorithms.},

The research paper recommendation systems have been advocated to address this problem. The existing research paper recommendation systems lack in exploiting prominent information of papers, such as relevancy with the current time, novelty, scientific contribution, writing complexity of the papers, etc. Further, the existing models emphasize only on user’s preference rather than user’s intention that may change with time. Furthermore, the existing models do not consider a sound ranking strategy to unleash the personalization aspect and relevancy of papers. This work aims to address the existing limitations and proposes a systematic hidden attribute-based recommendation engine ({SHARE}). {SHARE} utilizes a feature engineering technique to unfold valuable insights of papers through multiple hidden features. These features are used as a context for users as well as multiple criteria for ranking papers. Additionally, {SHARE} predicts a user’s intention beyond the user’s preference to capture the dynamic notion of a user. Finally, a novel ranking strategy is proposed to retrieve personalized and the most important papers. {SHARE} is flexible for recommending both old and new users. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of {SHARE} both user studies and system evaluations were performed. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of the proposed approach and are comparable to the existing systems.},

One of the most popular retrieval service methods is to find a set of papers similar to the paper under consideration, which requires a measure that computes the similarities between the papers. Scientific literature databases exhibit two interesting characteristics that are not found in general databases. First, the papers cited by older papers are often not included in the database due to technical and economic reasons. Second, since a paper references previously published papers, few papers cite recently published papers. These two characteristics cause all existing similarity measures to fail in at least one of the following cases: (1) measuring the similarity between old, but similar papers, (2) measuring the similarity between recent, but similar papers, and (3) measuring the similarity between two similar papers: one old, the other recent. In this paper, we propose a new link-based similarity measure called C-Rank, which uses both in-link and out-link references, disregarding the direction of the references. In addition, we discuss the most suitable normalization method for scientific literature databases and we propose an evaluation method for measuring the accuracy of similarity measures. For the experiments, we used real-world papers from {DBLP}’s database with reference information crawled from Libra. We then compared the performance of C-Rank with that of existing similarity measures. Experimental results showed that C-Rank achieved a higher accuracy than existing similarity measures.},

These problems have a set of variables, domain from which a variable takes its value and a set of constraints applied on these variables. For example N-Queen problem, timetabling problem, scheduling problem etc. are {CSPs}. In practical scenario, it is unlikely to obtain a solution that satisfies all constraints or most of the constraints. Such a solution is an exact solution. Even if an exact algorithm can be developed its time or space complexity may turnout unacceptable. In reality, it is often sufficient to find an approximate or partial solution to such {NP} problems using heuristic algorithms. Heuristic methods are used to speed up the process of finding a satisfactory solution, where an exhaustive search is impractical; hence resulting in guaranteed and approximate solutions.

Manual identification of publications to read, cite or consider as related papers relies on a researcher’s ability to identify fitting keywords or initial papers from which a literature search can be started. The rapidly increasing amount of papers has called for automatic measures to find the desired relevant publications, so-called paper recommendation systems. As the number of publications increases so does the amount of paper recommendation systems. Former literature reviews focused on discussing the general landscape of approaches throughout the years and highlight the main directions. We refrain from this perspective, instead we only consider a comparatively small time frame but analyse it fully. In this literature review we discuss used methods, datasets, evaluations and open challenges encountered in all works first released between January 2019 and October 2021. The goal of this survey is to provide a comprehensive and complete overview of current paper recommendation systems.},

The n-queens completion problem, introduced by Nauck in 1850, is to decide whether a given partial configuration can be completed to an n-queens configuration. In this paper, we study an extremal aspect of this question, namely: how small must a partial configuration be so that a completion is always possible? We show that any placement of at most n/60 mutually non-attacking queens can be completed. We also provide partial configurations of roughly n/4 queens that cannot be completed and formulate a number of interesting problems. Our proofs connect the queens problem to rainbow matchings in bipartite graphs and use probabilistic arguments together with linear programming duality.},

The first trick is to implement each assumption of the search with reversible local operations on doubly linked lists. By this trick, every step of the search affects the data incrementally. The second trick is to add a ghost square that represents the identity of each polyomino. Thus puts the rule that each polyomino be used once on the same footing as the rule that each square be covered once. The coding simplifies to a more abstract form which is equivalent to 0-1 integer programming. More significantly for the total computation time, the search can naturally switch between placing a fixed polyomino or covering a fixed square at different stages, according to a combined heuristic. Finally the author reports excellent performance for his algorithm for some familiar puzzles. These include tiling a hexagon by 19 hexiamonds and the N queens problem for N up to 18.},

	doi = {10.1186/s13561-018-0191-9},
	abstract = {A regional disparity is becoming increasingly important growth constraint. Policy makers need quantitative knowledge to design effective and targeted policies. In this paper, the regional efficiency of healthcare facilities in Slovakia is measured (2008-2015) using data envelopment analysis ({DEA}). The {DEA} is the dominant approach to assessing the efficiency of the healthcare system but also other economic areas. In this study, the window approach is introduced as an extension to the basic {DEA} models to evaluate healthcare technical efficiency in individual regions and quantify the basic regional disparities and discrepancies. The window {DEA} method was chosen since it leads to increased discrimination on results especially when applied to small samples and it enables year-by-year comparisons of the results. Two stable inputs (number of beds, number of medical staff), three variable inputs (number of all medical equipment, number of magnetic resonance ({MR}) devices, number of computed tomography ({CT}) devices) and two stable outputs (use of beds, average nursing time) were chosen as production variable in an output-oriented 4-year window {DEA} model for the assessment of technical efficiency in 8 regions. The database was made available from the National Health Information Center and the Slovak Statistical Office, as well as from the online databases Slovstat and {DataCube}. The aim of the paper is to quantify the impact of the non-standard Data Envelopment Analysis ({DEA}) variables as the use of medical technologies ({MR}, {CT}) on the results of the assessment of the efficiency of the healthcare facilities and their adequacy in the evaluation of the monitored processes. The results of the analysis have shown that there is an indirect dependence between the values of the variables over time and the results of the estimated efficiency in all regions. The regions that had low values of the variables over time achieved a high degree of efficiency and vice versa. Interesting knowledge was that the gradual addition of variables number of {MR}, number of {CT} and number of medical devices together, to the input side did not have a significant impact on the overall estimated efficiency of healthcare facilities.},

	abstract = {Background
Studies using Data Envelopment Analysis to benchmark Intensive Care Units ({ICUs}) are scarce. Previous studies have focused on comparing efficiency using only performance metrics, without accounting for resources. Hence, we aimed to perform a benchmarking analysis of {ICUs} using data envelopment analysis.

Methods
We performed a retrospective analysis on observational data of patients admitted to {ICUs} in Brazil ({ORCHESTRA} Study). The outputs in our data envelopment analysis model were the performance metrics: Standardized Mortality Ratio ({SMR}) and Standardized Resource Use ({SRU}); whereas the inputs consisted of three groups of variables that represented staffing patterns, structure, and strain, thus resulting in three models. We compared efficient and non-efficient units for each model. In addition, we compared our results to the efficiency matrix method and presented targets to each non-efficient unit.

Results
We performed benchmarking in 93 {ICUs} and 129,680 patients. The median age was 64 years old, and mortality was 12\%. Median {SMR} was 1.00 [interquartile range ({IQR}): 0.79–1.21] and {SRU} was 1.15 [{IQR}: 0.95–1.56]. Efficient units presented lower median physicians per bed ratio (1.44 [{IQR}: 1.18–1.88] vs. 1.7 [{IQR}: 1.36–2.00]) and nursing workload (168 hours [{IQR}: 168–291] vs 396 hours [{IQR}: 336–672]) but higher nurses per bed ratio (2.02 [1.16–2.48] vs. 1.71 [1.43–2.36]) compared to non-efficient units. Units from for-profit hospitals and specialized {ICUs} presented the best efficiency scores. Our results were mostly in line with the efficiency matrix method: the efficiency units in our models were mostly in the “most efficient” quadrant.

Conclusion
Data envelopment analysis provides managers the information needed to identify not only the outcomes to be achieved but what are the levels of resources needed to provide efficient care. Different perspectives can be achieved depending on the chosen variables. Its use jointly with the efficiency matrix can provide deeper understanding of {ICU} performance and efficiency.},

Some studies report ‘dramatic differences in efficiency’ and propose savings potentials of 50\%; others find an average efficiency in excess of 95\% and characterize almost 75\% of their observations as fully efficient. This study presents results for two datasets representative of two segments of the German hospital system. These segments comprise all hospitals that have one internal medicine and one surgery department; the hospitals are located in the old federal states of Germany. None of the hospitals provides tertiary care. {DEA} can be applied because all hospitals offer a comparable quality and range of services. The results were estimated with a {DEA}-bootstrapping procedure and suggest an average bias–corrected efficiency of around 80\%.},

However, the {DEA} standard approach ignores the unit's structure and assumes that the data are exact and reliable. In healthcare, these assumptions may not always hold true. To address these issues, a new approach was developed, which transformed the data into fuzzy trapezoidal numbers and used a network framework. The study was conducted using data from Portuguese public hospitals, including 18 variables related to efficiency, quality, and access. The data were then applied using a slack-based fuzzy network-{DEA} model that could handle undesirable outputs. Due to significant operational and environmental differences between hospitals in Portugal, a subsampling frontier approach based on exogenous variables was used. The results suggest that there is potential to improve hospital efficiency in Portugal by around 20\%, particularly in light of the {COVID}-19 pandemic. Additionally, variations in performance were observed depending on the size of the hospital.},

This chapter discusses recent developments in the statistical and econometric literature on {DEA} and {FDH} estimators that can be used to examine hospitals’ technical efficiency and productivity. Use of these new results and methods is illustrated by revisiting the Burgess and Wilson hospital studies of the 1990s to estimate and make inference about the technical efficiency of {US} hospitals, make inferences about returns to scale and other model features, and test for differences among {US} hospitals across ownership types and size groups in the context of a rigorous, statistical paradigm that was unavailable to researchers until recently.},

The analysis was completed with a determination of the sources of productivity changes (between the first and last year of the study period) and factors that influence efficiency.,Efficient regions have been identified and the spatial diversity in their efficiency was confirmed. The study identified individual efficiency trends together with “all-windows” best and worst performers. Using panel modeling, it was confirmed that the efficiency of health protection is influenced by, among others, accreditation certificates, the length of the waiting list or the number of medical personnel.,Although the analysis was conducted at the voivodeship level ({NUTS}2), which was fully justified, it would be equally important to analyze data with a lower aggregation level. It would be extremely valuable from the perspective of difficulties faced by the healthcare system in Poland.,The identification of areas and problems affecting the efficiency of the healthcare system in Poland may also be a hint for other countries with similar system solutions that also struggle with the same problems.,The paper explains the efficiency of the country's healthcare system while also paying attention to changes in its level, factors influencing it, spatial diversity and impact on the sector functioning.},

	abstract = {Background: Public hospitals’ expenditures in Italy is approximately 45\% of total public health financing. The reduction of public debt requires reducing total public health, as well as hospital expenditures in the public sector. Past health reforms introduced rules to improve the efficiency in controlling hospital costs with a better use of resources. The objective of this study is to derive technical efficiency as a performance measurement in the directly managed public hospitals in Italy under different case-mix specifications, as well as to discover the effect of it on technical efficiency.  Methods: Two different Data Envelopment Analysis ({DEA}) models are solved. To control for the influence of the case-mix complexity/severity of illness on technical efficiency, the distributions of {DEA} efficiency scores are compared applying statistical tests developed in the non-parametric efficiency analysis. Results: On average, in the year 2007, the technical efficiency in the sample is lower (0.8071) in model B (output mix with weighted Case Mix Index) than in model A (0.8748). The bootstrap-corrected efficiency scores of models B and A are respectively 0.7185 and 0.8106. On average, the case mix index in the sample is 0.87859. Statistical tests confirm that the differences in the efficiency scores distribution are statistically significant, confirming that treatment complexity has influenced technical efficiency. At the individual hospital level, the effect is more evident, modifying the rank and the technical efficiency of the hospitals. Conclusions: The different case-mix specifications adjusted with Case Mix Index, generate statistically significant differences in the distribution of the efficiency scores. This evidence permits us to conclude that the performance  of the Local Health Trust’s directly managed public Italian hospitals is influenced by the hospitals’ case-mix severity/complexity. As a policy indication, we can observe that the need for policy makers and hospital managers to reduce hospital costs conflicts with the need to guarantee an optimum level of hospital resources with different case-mix complexities of the treated cases.},

While there are numerous examples of the application of each approach to empirical data, this paper provides insights into the relative strengths of the estimation methods by applying both models to the same data. The translog results suggest that constant reruns are operant, whereas the {DEA} results suggest that both increasing and decreasing returns to scale may be observed in different segments of the production correspondence, in turn suggesting that the translog model may be `averaging' diametrically opposite behavior. On the other hand, by examining the rate of output transformation, both models agree that patient days devoted to care of children are more resource intensive than those devoted to adults or to the elderly. In addition, we compare estimates of technical efficiencies of individual hospitals obtained from the two methods. The {DEA} estimates are found to be highly related to the capacity utilization, but no such relationship was found for the translog estimates. This comparative application of different estimation models to the same data to obtain inferences about the nature of underlying cost and production correspondences sheds interesting light on the strengths of each approach, and suggests the need for additional research comparing estimation models using real as well as simulated data.},

	shorttitle = {The Effect of Activity-Based Financing on Hospital Efficiency},
	abstract = {Activity-based financing ({ABF}) was implemented in the Norwegian hospital sector from 1 July 1997. A fraction (30 to 50 per cent) of the block grant from the state to the county councils has been replaced by a matching grant depending upon the number and composition of hospital treatments. As a result of the reform, the majority of county councils have introduced activity-based contracts with their hospitals. This paper studies the effect of
activity-based funding on hospital efficiency. We predict that hospital efficiency will increase because the benefit from cost-reducing efforts in terms of number of treated patients is increased under {ABF} compared with global budgets. The prediction is tested using a panel
data set from the period 1992-2000. Efficiency indicators are estimated by means of data envelopment analysis ({DEA}) with multiple inputs and outputs. Using a variety of econometric methods, we find that the introduction of {ABF} has improved efficiency when measured as technical efficiency according to {DEA} analysis. Contrary to our prediction, the result is less uniform with respect to the effect on cost-efficiency. We suggest several reasons why this prediction fails. Keywords are poor information of costs, production-oriented drive, tight factor markets and soft budget constraints.},

The {DEA} results show the typical hospital services industry experienced 11 percent inefficiency in 1999. Moreover, multiple regression analysis indicates the level of technical efficiency varied directly across metropolitan hospital services industries in response to greater {HMO} activity and private health insurer concentration in the state. The analysis suggests the degree of rivalry among hospitals had no marginal effect on technical efficiency at the industry level.

In the first stage, a {DEA} model is used to calculate the {TE} scores of the examined healthcare systems in 2019 and 2010, following both the output and input orientations of efficiency. In the second stage, a censored Tobit model is estimated to investigate the determinants of healthcare efficiency.,{DEA} results of 2019 indicate that achievable efficiency gains of the Arab countries range from 0.4\% to 16\% under the output and input orientations, respectively. Six countries are efficient under both orientations. Although the average efficiency scores of the Arab countries have deteriorated between 2010 and 2019, Djibouti and Sudan had the greatest efficiency improvements between the two years. Bahrain, Mauritania, Morocco and Qatar proved to be efficient in 2010 and 2019 under the two orientations of efficiency and according to the two {DEA} specifications followed. The Tobit model reveals that corruption and government health expenditure tend to have an adverse impact on healthcare efficiency.,The author evaluates healthcare efficiency and healthcare's efficiency determinants in the Arab countries. Regardless Arab countries' diversity, these countries are facing common health challenges, including diminishing role of governments in healthcare financing; increased out-of-pocket healthcare spending; poor healthcare outputs and prevalence of health inequities resulting from weak governance institutions. Comparing the efficiency of healthcare systems between 2010 and 2019 gives insights on the potential impact of the Arab spring uprisings on healthcare efficiency. Moreover, examining the determinants of healthcare efficiency allows for better understanding of how to improve the efficiency of healthcare systems in the region.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the technical efficiency ({TE}) of the public district hospitals in Madhya Pradesh, India, with special emphasis on maternal healthcare services, using data envelopment analysis ({DEA}). Data from 40 district hospitals from January to December 2010 were collected from the health management information system and other records of the department of health and family welfare of the state. {DEA} was performed with input orientation and variable returns to scale assumption. {TE} and scale efficiency scores of the district hospitals were 0.90 ({SD}=0.14) and 0.88 ({SD}=0.15), respectively. Of the total district hospitals in the study, 20 (50\%) were technically efficient constituting the ‘best practice frontier’. The other half were technically inefficient, with an average {TE} score of 0.79 ({SD}=0.12) meaning that these hospitals could produce the same outputs by using 21\% less inputs from current input levels. Twenty-six (65\%) district hospitals were found to be scale inefficient, manifesting a mean score of 0.81 ({SD}=0.16). Half of the district hospitals in the study were operating inefficiently. Decision makers and administrators in the state should identify the causes of the observed inefficiencies and take appropriate measures to increase efficiency of these hospitals.},

	abstract = {Background: Measuring hospital efficiency is one of the tools for determining how to use resources. Considering the necessity of measuring the efficiency in hospitals, the current study was conducted to evaluate the efficiency and its determining factors in the Hospitals affiliated to medical universities in Tehran. Methods: This was a descriptive-analytical and longitudinal study. In the first stage of the research, the variables affecting the efficiency of hospitals were extracted using the Delphi method. In the second stage, th. Efficiency of 29 public hospitals in Tehran from 2012 to 2016 was calculated using data envelopment analysis techniques. We performed a sensitivity analysis of the efficiency scores by running the {DEA} model several times using different combinations of input variables. At last, applying the Tobit regression, factors explaining the inefficiencies of hospitals were determined. Data analysis was done by {STATA} 12 and {SPSS} 16 software. Significance level of all the tests was set at .05. Results: In the first stage, 10 input variables and 10 output variables necessary from the mangers' point of view were identified to test efficiency. In the second stage, the mean of hospital efficiency was ascending from 2012 to 2015, and then it descending after 2015.

	abstract = {Objective: The present study aimed to evaluate the operational efficiency of public hospitals in Fujian Province and the factors responsible for the inefficiency of these hospitals and provide relevant suggestions for health policymakers in allocating service resources.Method: In the first stage of the research, the variables affecting the efficiency of hospitals were extracted by qualitative and quantitative methods, including literature optimization, grey related analysis and grey clustering evaluation. In the second stage,the data envelopment analysis ({DEA}) method was used to evaluate the operational efficiency of 49 hospitals of different levels and types selected by sampling in 2020. Finally, a Tobit regression model with introduced institutional factors and background factors was established to study the main influencing factors of hospital inefficiency.Results: In the first stage, 10 input variables and 10 output variables necessary from the mangers' point of view were identified to test efficiency. In the second stage, the average comprehensive {TE}, {PTE}, and {SE} of 49 sample hospitals was 0.802, 0.888, and 0.902, respectively. 22.45\% of these hospitals met the effective criteria, i.e., the overall effective rate was 22.45\%. The low {SE} value of the hospital was the main reason hindering the improvement of the comprehensive efficiency value. The overall effective rate of secondary public hospitals (30.77\%) was higher than that of tertiary public hospitals (19.44\%), and the overall effective rate of public specialized hospitals (30\%) was higher than that of general public hospitals (18.92\%). Based on the third stage results, the bed occupancy rate({BOR}) and the proportion of beds({POB}) were major factors affecting the operation efficiency of grade {III} hospitals (p{\textless}0.01). However, the operating efficiency of grade {II} hospitals was significantly affected by {POB} and regional per capita {GDP}({GDPPC}) (p{\textless}0.05). Moreover, the impact of {BOR} and {GDPPC} was positive, and {POB} was negatively correlated with hospital operation efficiency.Conclusions: The study results indicated that the overall operation efficiency of public hospitals in Fujian Province is low. This study revealed that intervention should be strengthened from a policy and management perspective to improve the operation efficiency of public hospitals.},

It begins by reviewing the two primary empirical methods used in healthcare efficiency studies, emphasising the treatment of inefficiency persistence. Second, previous contributions to healthcare productivity research are discussed with a focus on methodology and findings. In the third section, various measures of outputs, inputs, and prices in health literature are explored to determine the extent of consensus in the literature. On the methodological front, the literature review shows that while the Data Envelopment Analysis and the Stochastic Frontier Analysis have been used extensively in healthcare productivity and efficiency studies, their application in the context of longitudinal data is limited. Further, no study currently undertakes to measure the {TFP} changes and its components that use both primal and dual approaches. There is also a considerable variation in the use of inputs, outputs, and price variables, suggesting that the use of variables in healthcare productivity and efficiency literature rests on the balance between data availability and the research scope.},

Although these methods have the potential to be useful to decision makers, their utility is limited by both methodological questions concerning their application. The aim of this paper is to search articles applying combined data envelopment analysis ({DEA}) and stochastic frontier analysis ({SFA}) in order to facilitate a common understanding about the adequacy of these methods, defining any differences in healthcare efficiency estimation and the reasons that are behind this. A systematic review of 21 such studies published the last decade was conducted. Only studies written in English were considered. Results are summarized in a form of meta-analysis in order to synthesize results and draw out further implications. Overall, {DEA} and {SFA} were found to yield divergent efficiency estimates due to many factors such as statistical noise, how inputs and outputs were defined, as well as data availability. Researchers, besides the combination of models to measure efficiency, lately have introduced environmental variables in their analyses, aiming at better understanding the relationship of these factors to efficiency and thus achieving a better decision making process. In any case the analysis concludes that there is a need for careful attention by stakeholders since the nature of the data and its availability influence the measurement of efficiency and thus it is necessary to model the behavior which generates the data by choosing the appropriate mathematical form},

Several different forecasting models are combined to increase forecasting accuracy. The proposed optimal ensemble method has three stages. The first stage uses the k-means method to classify wind power generation data into five distinct categories. In the second stage, five single prediction models, including a K-nearest neighbors ({KNN}) model, a recurrent neural network ({RNN}) model, a long short-term memory ({LSTM}) model, a support vector regression ({SVR}) model, and a random forest regression ({RFR}) model, are used to determine five categories of wind power data to generate a preliminary forecast. The final stage uses an optimal ensemble forecasting method for one-day-ahead hourly forecasting. This stage uses swarm-based intelligence ({SBI}) algorithms, including the particle swarm optimization ({PSO}), the salp swarm algorithm ({SSA}) and the whale optimization algorithm ({WOA}) to optimize the weight distribution for each single model. The final predicted value is the weighted sum of the integral for each individual model. The proposed method is applied to a 3.6 {MW} wind power generation system that is located in Changhua, Taiwan. The results show that the proposed optimal ensemble model gives more accurate forecasts than the single prediction models. When comparing to the other ensemble methods such as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ({LASSO}) and ridge regression methods, the proposed {SBI} algorithm also allows more accurate prediction.},

	abstract = {The prediction of wind power output is part of the basic work of power grid dispatching and energy distribution. At present, the output power prediction is mainly obtained by fitting and regressing the historical data. The medium- and long-term power prediction results exhibit large deviations due to the uncertainty of wind power generation. In order to meet the demand for accessing large-scale wind power into the electricity grid and to further improve the accuracy of short-term wind power prediction, it is necessary to develop models for accurate and precise short-term wind power prediction based on advanced algorithms for studying the output power of a wind power generation system. This paper summarizes the contribution of the current advanced wind power forecasting technology and delineates the key advantages and disadvantages of various wind power forecasting models. These models have different forecasting capabilities, update the weights of each model in real time, improve the comprehensive forecasting capability of the model, and have good application prospects in wind power generation forecasting. Furthermore, the case studies and examples in the literature for accurately predicting ultra-short-term and short-term wind power generation with uncertainty and randomness are reviewed and analyzed. Finally, we present prospects for future studies that can serve as useful directions for other researchers planning to conduct similar experiments and investigations.},

The swarm intelligence methods, including particle swarm optimization ({PSO}), salp swarm algorithm ({SSA}) and whale optimization algorithm ({WOA}), are used to optimize the weight allocation for each single model. The final prediction is then generated using the weighted sum of each single prediction model. A wind power generation system that is located in Changhua, Taiwan is used to validate the proposed method. Testing results show that the proposed method provides more stable and accurate prediction than each single model. The proposed method also allows more accurate predictions compared to Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator ({LASSO}) and ridge regression methods.},

The market participants have to deal the wind power output for different market time horizon in order to minimize the deviations of their trading schedules. In order to control the balance between production and consumption, transmission system operators need information in advance, concerning wind generation, to prepare necessary types of reserves and to activate them in real time. The wind power forecasting is frequently identified as an important tool to address the variability and uncertainty of the wind power and to more efficiently operate the power systems with large wind power penetrations.

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to address the challenges regarding the safety and economics of power system operation after the integration of a high proportion of wind power. In response to the limitations of the literature, which often fails to simultaneously consider both aspects, we propose a solution based on a stochastic optimization scheduling model. Firstly, we consider the uncertainty of day-ahead wind power forecasting errors and establish a multi-scenario day-ahead stochastic optimization scheduling model. By balancing the reserve capacity and economic efficiency in the optimization scheduling, we obtain optimized unit combinations that are applicable to various scenarios. Secondly, we account for the auxiliary service constraints of thermal power units participating in deep peak shaving, and develop an intra-day dynamic economic dispatch model. Through the inclusion of thermal power units and energy storage units in the optimization scheduling, the accommodation capacity of wind power is further enhanced. Lastly, in the electricity market environment, increasing wind power capacity can increase the profits of thermal power peak shaving. However, we observe a trend of initially increasing and subsequently decreasing wind power profits as the wind power capacity increases. Considering system flexibility and the curtailed wind power rate, it is advisable to moderately install grid-connected wind power capacity within the power system. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling model in managing day-ahead uncertainty and enhancing the accommodation of wind power.},
